					<h2>Reading and books</h2>
					<p>Reading in My Life.<br>
                     Reading plays a very important role in the life of people. 
                     It educates a person, enriches his intellect. 
                     Books help to mould a person's character, form his moral values.
                     Besides, books bring pleasure and delight. It's a wonderful way to spend spare time.
                     Sometimes we read the same book again and again. 
					 Thanks to books we learn to express our thoughts and feelings more exactly.
					 The book is a faithful and understanding friend. 
					 It can be put aside and taken up again at any moment. 
					 There are books which have been our favorites since childhood.
					 People are fond of reading different kinds of books. 
					 Some people enjoy reading detective stories, adventure stories,
					 novels, biographies, other prefer classics. 
					 Fairy tales are enjoyed and read by children,
					 books about adventures and journeys are enjoyed by those who are fond of travelling. 
					 Legends and myths are read by those who are fond of history.
